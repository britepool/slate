# Introduction

Welcome to BritePool's API for Demand Side Platforms (DSP)! This API has been specifically designed to facilitate the smooth and efficient sharing of BritePool's ID through the entire bid request, response, and win notification (when applicable) process.

A key component of this API is the use of the BritePool *Metric* which contains all the essential pieces of information that should be communicated during each of these three processes. Since each of these events involves somewhat different pieces of data, the BritePool API for DSPs employs three distinct metric types: one for win notifications, one for bid requests, and one for bid responses.
